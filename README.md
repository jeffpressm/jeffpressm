- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeff Pressman
- 👀 I’m mostly a product-first entrepreneur, but I'm always trying to learn more technical skills.
- 👷🏽‍♂️ I'm working on a new project to make it easier for more people to help nonprofits with their professional skills.
- 👷🏼‍♂️ I also sit on the boards of a few VC-backed software companies doing exciting work.
